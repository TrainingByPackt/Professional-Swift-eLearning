# Professional Swift [eLearning]
We begin the course by learning about value types (structs and enums), and when they are preferable over classes. We also learn about the copy-on-write technique and how to implement it ourselves. Then we learn how to load JSON from web APIs into our custom types, and how to export that content out again. Finally, we learn how to create frameworks, and import other frameworks using CocoaPods or Carthage.

We move on to learn advanced uses of Swift protocols and how protocol-oriented development improves efficiency and leads to more maintainable and reusable code. Then we learn about generics, and how they enable us to support multiple types without duplication. Later in the course, we discover different ways to structure a complete iOS app from scratch. We begin the discussion with the well-known MVC pattern and cover every other trending architecture in the iOS world.


## What you will learn
* Load content from web APIs into structs
* Explore methods to store structs to files
* Implement the copy-on-write technique
* Study protocols and protocol-oriented programming in depth
* Write code with less duplication using generics
* Compare different architectural patterns for iOS apps
( Create an IoS app using Redux

### Hardware requirements
For an optimal learning experience, we recommend the following hardware configuration:
* A Mac computer capable of running macOS Sierra 10.12:
* MacBook (Late 2009 or newer)
* MacBook Pro (Mid 2010 or newer)
* MacBook Air (Late 2010 or newer)
* Mac mini (Mid 2010 or newer)
* iMac (Late 2009 or newer)
* Mac Pro (Mid 2010 or newer)

### Software requirements
You must also install in advance the following software:
* macOS 10.12.6+
* Xcode 9
Before beginning the course, ensure that you complete the following steps:
1. If not already installed, install Xcode 9 from Mac App Store. 
2. Launch it, agree to license agreement and answer yes to installing additional required components if asked.
3. Go to the Terminal.
4. Install homebrew, cocoapods and Carthage:
```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew install CocoaPods
brew install Carthage
```
